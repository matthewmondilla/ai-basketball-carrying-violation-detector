## 🏀 The Problem
Carrying is a basketball violation where a player decides to carry the ball in between dribbling actions. What makes this violation problematic is how fast-paced it is for even NBA referees to miss it oftentimes during live games. You can see tons and tons of videos on YouTube showcasing different NBA players violating this rule (yikes!). Below is an example.

Let me be clear. I’m not saying that players are getting worse or that referees aren’t doing their jobs. Carrying violations are often unintentional from players (fingers crossed 🤞), and referees missing them is completely understandable given the fast-paced nature of basketball. Even the best referees in the world can’t catch everything happening in real-time, because, let’s face it, they’re only human.
